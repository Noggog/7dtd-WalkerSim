  Offline zombmies will always start at a random map border position, so at at first in-game day
  they would be all scattered at the border. This allows you to simulate ahead on the initial startup.
  The simulation runs at a fixed tick rate of 40 hz.

  Makes the simulation persistent, if you want to wipe/restart the simulation there are two choices:
  1: The plugin has a command to reset the simulation: "walkersim reset"
  2: You can delete the simulation data located at your save path named WalkerSim.bin
  NOTE: Turning this off will always restart the simulation whenever the server restarts.

	Divides the entire map into zones, the zone divider is used on each axis (xy).
	Offline zombies will use these zones as their goal targets, once a specific zone is 
	reached with a local offset they will pick a new zone that is close by.

	Population density per square kilometer, this parameter drives the amount of zombies per map size.
	Some examples (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population_density):
	Increasing the population density will also make the game a lot harder, be careful here.

	Given that EnemySpawnMode is required to be set to false sleepers are also affected.
	The simulation attempts to compensate sleepers by placing offline zombies at the pre-defined position,
	once sleepers are activated and killed they will respawn at the border like every other offline zombie
	with the exception that they will travel towards their pre-defined position and stay there once arrived.
